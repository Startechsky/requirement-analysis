# Requirement Analysis in Software Development. 
This repository was created to explain the purpose, importance and types of requirement analysis in SDLC (software development life cycle) 

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis are the features or requirements a software application to be developed must have. It is face in the software development life cycle where the team gathers, analyze and determines the features and capabilities of a software pre production.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis explains the scope of a project and helps developers determine the required time and resources required in developing a perticular product, requirement analysis also helps in gaining clarity about the purpose of a product and determining or crafting the accpetance criteeria of products.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation üìö
Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

# Types Of Requirement Analysis

Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
Definition: Describe what the system should do.
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

Key Functional Requirements:

Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

Key Non-functional Requirements:

Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.

# What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
Creating Use Case Diagrams:

Actors:  guests, registered user, admin
Use Cases: search properties, book property, manage listings

Interaction between actors and use cases: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oySWJiqF3sPw1cd30U54rTNY24wg2lfu/view?usp=sharing

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.

# Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ
Objective: Establishing clear criteria for feature completion.

What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders.

Benefits of Acceptance Criteria:

Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
Provide a basis for testing and validation.
Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.

# Acceptance criteria For Booking System
-  Login and ccreate account features
-  Profile set up feature
-  Section to select list of preferred or favourite properties
-  Booking feature / save to cart feature
-  Payment feature
-  Authrntication feature
-  Receipt generation feature
